* Regolith Desktop configuration

A light theme for *Regolith version R1.4.x*, used with [[https://practicalli.github.io/][Practicalli live broadcasts and screencasts]].

The =.Xresource= files are used to define the theme for Regolith and its associated applications (eg. suckless terminal).

The GTK theme defines the Gnome desktop windows and Gnome specific apps (control panel, gnome tweaks, window decorations for all apps, etc.).

The =Xresources= files can be used with any Gnome theme you prefer.

The terminal used the [[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k][Powerlevel10k zsh theme]] and required the [[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k][Meslo Nerd font]] installed.  To use the Ubuntu font, edit the Xresources-typeface file and use the Ubuntu Mono configuration (commented).


## Previous Regolith releases
The configuration has changes between recent versions of Reglolith.  Using the following commits should you have an earlier version of Regolith Linux.
- [[https://github.com/practicalli/regolith-solarized-light/commit/730676f779a97dc58622fcc86d2b6e93e30563e8][commit 730676f]] for Regolith 1.3.1
- [[https://github.com/practicalli/regolith-solarized-light/commit/ac78f9bb0dc8d101ad7d6b5d55963bc005602ac0][commit ac78f9b]] for Regolith 1.3.0

  This theme does not work with Regolith 1.2.x or earlier.

** Requirements
   This theme hack requires the installation of the GTK theme called Solarized Light.

   Download the [[https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1309911/][solarized light full desktop theme]] and extract into =~/.themes/=. If ubuntu-desktop is installed, then you can use the smaller [[https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1312496/][Solarized light theme]] instead

   The theme also uses the [[https://snwh.org/moka/download][Faba Icons]], although you can use any available icon pack.  Using =gnome-tweak= will show you the themes available (=sudo apt install gnome-tweak=)

   The theme also uses Ubuntu font family, although this can be changed in =Xresources-typeface=.

   [[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k][Powerlevel10k zsh theme]] and required the [[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k][Meslo Nerd font]] for the zsh theme.

   Finally, it has a [[https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/master/practicalli-desktop-redux.png][custom background]], so update the =Xresources-theme= configuration to use your own preferred background, eg. =/usr/share/backgrounds/regolith-structure-7.png= (on Ubuntu systems)

** Using this theme
   Clone this theme to your computer, for example `~/project/linux/regolith-config`

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/practicalli/regolith-solarized-light.git ~/projects/linux/regolith-config
#+END_SRC

   Edit the =Xresources-regolith= file and replace `/home/practicalli` with the location of your login account directory.

   Create symbolic links for each file

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ln -s projects/linux/regolith-config/Xresources-regolith .Xresources-regolith
  ln -s projects/linux/regolith-config/Xresources-color .Xresources-color
  ln -s projects/linux/regolith-config/Xresources-theme .Xresources-theme
  ln -s projects/linux/regolith-config/Xresources-typeface .Xresources-typeface
  ln -s projects/linux/regolith-config/Xresources-st-term .Xresources-st-term
  ln -s projects/linux/regolith-config/Xresources-rofi.rasi-1.3.1 .Xresources-rofi.rasi
#+END_SRC

   Apply the theme using =regolith-look refresh= or restart Regolith desktop with =Super+Shift+b=.


** Hacking the theme together
 - [X] Copy Regolith configuration from =/etc/regolith/i3/config= to =~/.config/regolith/i3/config=
 - [X] =.Xresources-regolith= as central theme file
 - [X] =.Xresources-color= solarized-light theme colors
 - [X] =.Xresources-theme= GTK theme & icon, desktop wallpaper, rofi theme
 - [X] =.Xresources-typeface= fonts & sizes, glyphs for regolith
 - [X] =.Xresources-st-term= Suckless terminal color and font configuration, using definitions in =.Xresources-color=
 - [X] =.Xresources-rofi.rasi= not sure what these change yet
 - [X] Move all configuration files to a project and create symbolic links
 - [X] Create a Git repository and share on GitHub
